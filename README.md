PHP Library that makes it easier to use Real Estate Verticals Open API and examples that show how to use the library. Examples are made for otodom.pl (for now), but the code for storia.ro and otodom.ua should be fairly similar.

## How to install

To use the library, you need to have [composer](http://getcomposer.org) installed.

Please add the following repository to your `composer.json` file:

    "repositories": [
        {

            "type": "git"
        }
    ],

and one line to the `require` section:

    "require": {
        "europeverticalsrealestate/openapi-sdk": "*"
    },

then run `composer install`.

## How to use the library
